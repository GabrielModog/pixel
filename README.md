Pixel is a tiny editor meant to be used within a tiny game creation tool I'm planning. At its current state you can only create 8x8 stuff with black pixels and download it.

## Usage
Pixel by itself is stackless, which means it uses only standard HTML, CSS and JS.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:coelhucas/pixel.git
cd pixel
open index.html
```

Click and drag to draw

<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to reset on macOS

<kbd>F5</kbd> to reset on windows/linux

Press download to download your pixel art as png

## TODO
- [ ] Add a small default palette
- [ ] Make it responsive
- [ ] Add eraser
- [x] Add reset button
- [x] Make it possible to download it in other scales
- [ ] 1x previewer (I can use the virtual canvas)
- [ ] Bucket [reference](http://www.williammalone.com/articles/html5-canvas-javascript-paint-bucket-tool/)

*Maybe other sizes layer?
