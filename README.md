Pixel is a tiny editor meant to be used within a tiny game creation tool I'm planning. At its current state you can only create 8x8 stuff with black pixels and download it.

## Usage
Pixel by itself is stackless, which means it uses only standard HTML, CSS and JS.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:coelhucas/pixel.git
cd pixel
open index.html
```

Click and drag to draw

<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to reset on macOS

<kbd>F5</kbd> to reset on windows/linux

Press download to download your pixel art as png

## TODO
- [ ] Add a small default palette
- [ ] Make it responsive
- [ ] Add eraser
- [ ] Add reset button
- [ ] Make it possible to download it as 1x[^1]
- [ ] 1x previewer[^1]

[ˆ1]: Maybe other sizes later?
